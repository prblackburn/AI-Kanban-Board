# Development History - Paul (Frontend)

## Progress Summary
**Last Updated**: Current session  
**Status**: TICKET-009 complete, task deletion functionality fully implemented with confirmation and enhanced UX

## Completed Tickets

### TICKET-004: Base Component Structure ✅
**Implementation Details:**
- Created complete component architecture with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Components Created:**
  - `KanbanBoard.tsx` - Main container with 3-column grid layout, task filtering by status
  - `ColumnHeader.tsx` - Displays column title and task count
  - `TaskCard.tsx` - Task display with status update/delete forms, confirmation dialogs
  - `AddTaskForm.tsx` - Task creation form with validation
- **Additional Files:**
  - `app/types.ts` - TypeScript interface definitions for Task type

### TICKET-005: Static UI Implementation ✅
**Implementation Details:**
- Enhanced existing components with modern styling and improved UX
- **Enhanced Components:**
  - `KanbanBoard.tsx` - Added gradient background, responsive layout, empty state illustrations
  - `ColumnHeader.tsx` - Status-specific color coding, icons, improved badges
  - `TaskCard.tsx` - Better visual hierarchy, hover effects, accessibility improvements
  - `AddTaskForm.tsx` - Responsive form layout, enhanced styling
- **Additional Features:**
  - Status-specific color schemes (gray/blue/green)
  - Empty state SVG icons for each column
  - Hover transitions and improved focus states
  - Mobile-responsive design
- **Technical Fixes:**
  - Fixed type compatibility: `createdAt` → `created_at` to match database schema
  - Removed inline TaskCard implementation from route file
  - Used existing component architecture instead of rewriting

### Database Connection Resolution ✅
**Issue**: `better-sqlite3` native bindings compilation failed
**Root Cause**: Python 3.13 removed `distutils` module required by `node-gyp`
**Solution**: Installed `setuptools` (`pip3 install setuptools --break-system-packages`)
**Result**: Full SQLite database functionality working

### Remix Form Integration ✅
**Issue 1**: Native HTML forms not compatible with Remix patterns
**Issue 2**: Form routing error - "Route 'root' does not have an action"
**Solution**: 
- Replaced all `<form>` with `<Form>` from `@remix-run/react`
- Removed `action="/"` props (forms auto-submit to current route)
**Changes**:
- `AddTaskForm.tsx` - Added Remix Form import, removed action prop
- `TaskCard.tsx` - Converted forms to Remix Forms, removed action props
**Result**: Proper form routing to `_index` route where action function exists

## Technical Standards Established
- **Component Architecture**: Feature-based organization (`/board`, `/tasks`)
- **Forms**: Remix Form components, omit action prop to auto-submit to current route
- **Form Validation**: Return JSON errors from actions, use `useActionData` for error display
- **UX Patterns**: Loading states with `useNavigation`, accessible error messages with ARIA
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with modern design patterns, color-coded validation states
- **TypeScript**: Strict interfaces, proper typing
- **Database**: SQLite with better-sqlite3, graceful error handling
- **Build**: ES modules with `.cjs` configs where needed

## Current State
- **Database**: Fully functional at `/database/kanban.db`
- **UI**: Modern, accessible, responsive design with enhanced UX feedback
- **Build System**: All commands working (dev, build, lint, typecheck)
- **Architecture**: Clean separation with full CRUD operations implemented
- **Task Management**: Full task lifecycle - create, status updates, deletion all functional

### TICKET-006: Data Integration ✅
**Implementation Details:**
- Tasks properly load from database and display in correct columns
- Empty states with visual feedback for each column
- Task filtering by status working correctly
- Real-time UI updates after database changes
**Note**: This was already implemented from previous work

### TICKET-007: Task Creation ✅
**Implementation Details:**
- **Enhanced Form Validation**: Added comprehensive client and server-side validation
- **Loading States**: Spinner animation and disabled button during submission
- **Error Handling**: Accessible error messages with ARIA attributes and color-coded validation
- **UX Improvements**: Visual feedback with red borders for errors, proper form reset
- **Technical Implementation**: 
  - Modified route action to return JSON errors instead of throwing Response
  - Added `useActionData` and `useNavigation` hooks for state management
  - Enhanced accessibility with proper ARIA attributes

### TICKET-008: Task Status Updates ✅
**Implementation Details:**
- **Enhanced TaskCard Component**: Added loading states using `useNavigation` hook
- **Status Update Flow**: Implemented logical flow (todo → doing → done → todo) with proper form submissions
- **Visual Feedback**: Added spinner animations and disabled states during form submissions
- **UX Improvements**: 
  - Loading states with "Moving..." text and spinner for status updates
  - Disabled buttons during submission to prevent double-clicks
  - Dynamic tooltips that change based on loading state
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Enhanced TaskCard with `useNavigation` hook for real-time form state tracking
  - Added proper disabled states and loading indicators
  - Improved accessibility with ARIA attributes and visual feedback
- **Code Quality**: All lint and typecheck requirements pass, ESLint configuration added

### TICKET-009: Task Deletion ✅
**Implementation Details:**
- **Delete Button**: Added to TaskCard with trash icon and proper styling
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Native JavaScript `confirm()` prompt prevents accidental deletion
- **Loading States**: Spinner animation and disabled state during deletion process
- **Enhanced UX**: 
  - Hover effects on delete button (gray → red transition)
  - Dynamic tooltips showing current state ("Delete task" / "Deleting task...")
  - Immediate visual feedback during form submission
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Remix Form with delete action connected to server-side validation
  - Enhanced TaskCard with `useNavigation` hook for deletion state tracking
  - Server-side error handling and proper HTTP responses
  - Progressive enhancement (works without JavaScript)
- **Code Quality**: All lint and typecheck requirements pass

**Ready for**: TICKET-010 (Testing and Lint Compliance) - all frontend functionality complete
