# Functional Specification: AI Kanban Board

## Project Overview

A collaborative Kanban board web application for managing tasks across three columns: "To Do", "Doing", and "Done". Built for local development with a focus on essential task management functionality.

## Core Requirements

### Must Have Features

1. **Three-Column Kanban Board**
   - Static layout with "To Do", "Doing", and "Done" columns
   - Visual separation between columns
   - Clean, simple interface using Tailwind CSS

2. **Task Management**
   - Add new tasks via a simple form
   - Display tasks as cards with title only
   - Move tasks between columns by clicking
   - Delete tasks with confirmation
   - All changes persist to database

3. **Data Persistence**
   - SQLite database for local storage
   - Tasks stored with minimal required fields
   - Database operations handled through raw SQL

4. **Live Updates**
   - UI updates immediately after database changes
   - Form submissions reload data from database
   - No real-time collaboration features needed

## User Stories

### Task Creation
- As a user, I can add a new task by filling out a form with a task title
- As a user, I can see my new task appear in the "To Do" column immediately
- As a user, I can see tasks persisted after refreshing the page

### Task Status Management
- As a user, I can click on a task to move it to the next column (To Do → Doing → Done)
- As a user, I can see the task status reflected in the correct column
- As a user, I can move tasks in any direction between columns

### Task Removal
- As a user, I can delete a task I no longer need
- As a user, I can see a confirmation before deleting a task
- As a user, I can see the task removed from the board immediately

## User Interface Requirements

### Layout
- Three equal-width columns displayed horizontally
- Column headers clearly labeled
- Task cards displayed vertically within each column
- Simple, clean design with consistent spacing

### Task Cards
- Display task title prominently
- Include creation timestamp
- Clear visual boundaries between cards
- Click target for status changes
- Delete button or action

### Forms
- Simple add task form with title input
- Submit button clearly labeled
- Form validation for required fields
- Clear error messages when needed

### User Experience
- Predictable, obvious interactions
- Consistent visual hierarchy
- Standard form patterns
- Clear action feedback

## Data Requirements

### Task Data Structure
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  status: 'todo' | 'doing' | 'done';
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('todo', 'doing', 'done')),
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Success Criteria

A successful implementation must:

1. **Load and Display Data**
   - Fetch all tasks from SQLite database on page load
   - Display tasks in correct columns based on status
   - Show appropriate message when no tasks exist

2. **Handle User Interactions**
   - Successfully create new tasks through form submission
   - Move tasks between columns with immediate visual feedback
   - Delete tasks with confirmation and immediate removal

3. **Maintain Data Integrity**
   - All changes persist to database
   - Page refreshes show current data state
   - No data loss during normal operations

4. **Provide Good User Experience**
   - Interface is intuitive and self-explanatory
   - Actions provide clear feedback
   - Error states are handled gracefully

## Out of Scope

- User authentication or authorization
- Real-time collaboration between users
- Task editing after creation
- Task descriptions or additional metadata
- Drag and drop functionality
- Advanced filtering or search
- Mobile responsiveness
